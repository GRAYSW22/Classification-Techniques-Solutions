# Classification Techniques Solutions

## Project Overview
This project, titled "Classification Techniques Solutions," focuses on implementing and evaluating various classification techniques using Python. The project is documented in a Jupyter Notebook file (`Classification_Techniques_Solutions.ipynb`) and includes practical examples of applying classification algorithms to datasets.

## Data Source
The datasets used for this project are sourced from public data repositories. Details of the datasets and their sources are referenced within the Jupyter Notebook.

- **Primary Data Source**: 
  - [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/index.php)
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)

## Project Structure
The project consists of the following files and directories:

- `Classification_Techniques_Solutions.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing code, explanations, and results of the classification techniques applied.
- `data/`: Directory containing datasets used in the analysis (if applicable).
- `visualizations/`: Folder for any plots or graphs generated by the Notebook.
- `README.md`: This file, which provides a summary of the project and usage instructions.

## Summary
This project demonstrates the use of various classification algorithms, such as logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines (SVM). The Notebook includes data preprocessing steps, model training, evaluation, and comparison of different classification techniques to determine the best-performing model.

## Installation and Usage
To run this project, you need Python installed along with the following libraries:

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `scikit-learn`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`

### Steps to Run:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory and open the Jupyter Notebook file (`Classification_Techniques_Solutions.ipynb`).
3. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis and results.
